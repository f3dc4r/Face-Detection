# Face-Detection
Using this library https://github.com/justadudewhohacks/face-api.js and following this tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVClHLwv-4I I just added gender and age detection.
I hope it will be usefully for you.

Feel free to send me any suggestions to optimize and improve the code quality

Thank you
